         <h1>My First Semester Coding</h1>
         <p>
            <p>As a music student, taking a course that does not correspond with any of my other courses was a risk. Taking a course that I had no background knowledge on was an attempt to fail. It was my interest in understanding the power of the internet in our everyday lives and in how it affects our musicking that keeps me interested. I must say that I am enjoying the theory content more than the coding itself. However, I now understand that it all starts with the code. Most of my interaction with music start with a code, whether it is streaming or composing on a software, there is code. I am beginning to understand the power of this craft. I had decided from the moment I registered for this course that I will take it one day at a time and always remind myself not to compare myself people who have been coding for years. Therefore, for my first website, I have decided keep it simple, use code that I have learned during lectures and try not to do anything I have not yet learned in class. Here I will be giving a critical reflection of my website and the work we have done throughout the semester.</p>
            <p>Theory</p>
            <p>The theoretical component has been the one that I have enjoyed the most. Learning about the Web at critical levels that we have has allowed me the opportunity to see the impact of the Web in everyday life. My week 2 critical writing post is one that I wrote with no idea of what was required of me. I therefore put my own thoughts and opinions into the paper, rather than critically engage the Turing’s reading. However, I soon got the pattern of the level of engagement required to engage these readings. For weeks 4 and 6, I chose topics that would help broaden my understanding of the discourse of web development. In the first few weeks of the semester it was quite a grapple, to an extent still is, with understanding the discourse and language used. Therefore, I was beneficial for me to choose topics that would help me broaden my understanding. Nonetheless, I intentionally wrote short reflections as an attempt to not overwhelm myself. Week 9’s critical reflection was one that required most of my engagement. Understanding Graham et al’s survey and the many questions it came with also made me realise how the internet is a reflection of the world and the relations of power we live in.</p>
            <p>Creative</p>
            <p>This component is what I think has helped me understand and practicalise the theory because with the language learnt from the theory and technical components, I made decisions on how I want my website to be. I also think I have leaned mostly on the creative component of the website to make it. This is because it is mostly personal decisions and very few rules to follow.</p>
            <p>Technical</p>
            <p>This component of the website was one that gave me the most ups and downs. The many ways in which on thing can be done made more tough to grasp. HTML is fairly straight forward. It is CSS and Javascript that I struggled with the most. CSS began frustrating me when the website changed when opened on different browsers. Work that we did on Flex and Grids helped me understand how to make a structured and neat website that is responsive. However, I only watched the lectures quite late, using Grids and Flex would have caused a lot of changes I would have not been able to fix in time. Also, making the website responsive for a phone sized device was an issue. This is because trying to fit an already functioning website to respond on different devices was difficult for me. Rather, it would have been better if I designed my website in the bounds of a smaller device from the beginning. Expanding to a bigger device would not have been a smaller issue than the vice. Laslty, website has very little Javascript, I am not even sure if it is enough and whether I used it appropriately to show my understanding of the language. That is because I still do not understand how it works, and what its purpose is for. I managed to have a few onmouse functions. However, that is all I could do with it.</p>
            <p>Conclusion</p>
            <p>My website is not at the level which I would have loved, but this is all on me. In the second block I did not manage my time well. This resulted in me running out of time and having to make short cuts. However, this is a lesson learned for the 2nd semester. Also, i think I have also learnt a building strategy that will work for me. I think it would have been better for me to understand grids and flexbox before understanding styling. That is because structure matters to me more than styling. So this is something I will use to for next semester.</p>

           Wireframes and Ideas
        </h2>
        <p>
        <p>The goal of the design of the website is to reflect a calm space where the user can learn about me. I wanted to create a simple and clam tone of colour that would reflect me as a person. The easiest way for me to get this right was to find a picture find that had “calm” colours, but also gave out the idea of where I am in my life at the moment. Therefore, finding a picture that showed some kind of journey was what I was aiming for. After finding a suitable picture for my background, I stuck to the colours on the picture for my styling. The picture consists mainly of 4 colours: grey, black, orange and white. These were my colour choices. I then decided to take advantage of the light/dark contrasts between the 4 colours. White and Yellow would be used in contract to Black and Grey.</p>
        <p>All of my writing on the website is in white. This is to contrast the grey colour of the background. Moreover, in areas where there is a lot of reading to do and the font is small, I decided to use to a constant faded black background to avoid the reader struggling to navigate the read with inconsistent tones of grey of the background picture.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the font was ‘clear and readable’. For the blog, the font initially felt big for my eyes, but I remembered how many times I usually zoom into a text because I cannot comfortably read what is written on a website. I also want to contrast my heading fonts with other fonts on the website, especially the header front. I wanted the heading points to full the user. Therefore I used more friendlier fonts and font styles, in contrast to the straight font style of the header. </p>
